## üìå Project Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Source (Live from Web)**
- Directly accessed and streamed ODI match data from `https://cricsheet.org/downloads/odis_json.zip`
- Each match is stored as an individual `.json` file within the zip

### 2. **Data Extraction & Transformation (Python)**
- Parsed JSON files directly in memory without saving locally
- Extracted relevant information:
  - Match metadata: date, venue, event, teams, outcome, toss info
  - Batting stats: total runs, overs (excluding wide/no balls), wickets
  - Additional context: player of match, target score, legitimate overs
- Handled cricket-specific logic (e.g., overs as decimal, extras filtering)
- Output saved as a clean and structured CSV: `odi_summary.csv`

### 3. **Data Ingestion into Azure Databricks**
- Uploaded curated CSV files to Azure Databricks
- Created two sandbox tables:
  - `odi_summary`: match-level structured data
  - `stadiums`: cleaned stadium and location mapping 

### 4. **SQL Analysis in Databricks Notebooks**
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze:
  - Top 5 Most Dominant Wins by Margin (All Time)
  - Toss Impact vs Batting Order Win Rate
  - Top 3 Teams with Highest Win Rate When Chasing (Min 50 Matches)
  - Highest Target Chased by Each Team
  - Top 10 Stadiums by Average Runs Scored

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard Integration**
- Connected Power BI to Databricks using ODBC
- Created interactive dashboards on:
  - Match Summary (Matches Played, Matches by Venue using filled map)
  - Venue-wise Comparision (RPO per innings, Wickets Fallen per innings, Toss Decision)
  - Team-wise Analysis
